### ✅ Suggested Daily Prompt to Ask an AI:

> I’m building my real-world coding and problem-solving skills without relying too much on AI for actual implementation. Please give me **one daily coding challenge** that:
>
> * Is not a traditional DSA problem
> * Involves **real-world logic or implementation** like building a UI interaction, writing a script, designing a small game, simulating an app behavior, etc.
> * Is **medium** in complexity (15–60 mins coding time)
> * Can be implemented with just core logic (no large frameworks or boilerplate)
> * Optionally involves file I/O, async behavior, state handling, or basic algorithms
>
> Provide:
>
> * A clear **problem statement**
> * Expected **input and output**
> * Optional **bonus features** or constraints for extra challenge
> * Mention which **language(s)** I could try it in (but I’ll pick)
