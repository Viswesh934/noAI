### **Problem Statement:**

You're working on improving productivity and need a way to time your tasks using the terminal. Build a simple **Task Timer CLI Tool** that lets a user:

1. Start a named task.
2. Optionally pause/resume the task.
3. Stop the task and show the total time spent (excluding pauses).
4. Save a log of the session to a local file (e.g., `task_log.txt`).
